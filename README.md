# Strategy Game Demo
A strategy game prepared in accordance with the SOLID principle. Structures can be spawned in the game and placed in appropriate cells. Units / soldiers can be produced from these structures. Units act with the A* algorithm and attack another unit and structures. In the project, an infinite scroll was created to list the structures and select the appropriate structure.
